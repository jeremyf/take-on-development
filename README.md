## About

This work has been a labor of love. I write it in my spare time.

I also write [developer/development related blog posts](http://ndlib.github.io) for my day job.

If you are feeling generous please consider throwing a tip my way via Paypal to jeremy.n.friesen@gmail.com
or give a donation to the [American Civil Liberties Union](https://www.aclu.org/) or [Wikipedia](https://donate.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:FundraiserLandingPage&country=US).

I warn you, this work is not complete. However I hope there is useful information in its gestational state.
This is something I feel needs to get out and into the open.

## Softcover

This ebook was built using the [Softcover gem](https://github.com/softcover/softcover).
I found it to be the best for how my brain works.

Take a look. Its good stuff.
