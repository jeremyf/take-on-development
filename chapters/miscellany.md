# Miscellany

Aside from Google and Stack Exchange, here are a few resources that rise to the top.

## Ruby Rogues

[Ruby Rogues is a free podcast](http://rubyrogues.com/) with panelists speaking on all things Ruby and more.
It is well produced and I find it very informative.

## Ruby Tapas

[Ruby Tapas is a bi-weekly screencast](http://www.rubytapas.com/) of short forays into intermediate and advanced Ruby topics.

## Railscasts

An aging [collection of Ruby on Rails screencasts](
http://railscasts.com/).
There is a lot of information that still holds value.
Take a look at the [Free Episodes](http://railscasts.com/?type=free)

## Thoughtbot's Blog

A diverse collection of [blog posts by a preeminent Rails development](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/) shop.

## Other Promising Endeavors

If you've worked in Rails for awhile, you are aware of the painful edge cases. Its a massive framework with lots of interlocked components. This past year I've explored other frameworks and modifications to existing frameworks:

* [Lotus Framework](http://lotusrb.org/) - open source software for MVC web development. It's simple, fast, and lightweight. Each of its components exist in isolation. But together they offer a lightweight alternative to Rails.
* [Trailblazer](https://github.com/apotonick/trailblazer/) - "Trailblazer is a thin layer on top of Rails. It gently enforces encapsulation, an intuitive code structure and gives you an object-oriented architecture."
* [Wyriki](https://github.com/jimweirich/wyriki) - Please take a moment to review the repository that contains the late Jim Weirich's last commit. He was a teacher and mentor to many. His software is expressive and accessible.
* [Ruby Object Mapper](https://github.com/rom-rb/rom) A persistence and mapping toolkit for Ruby.
