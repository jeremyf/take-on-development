# Modes of Development

For me, software development is a juggling act.
I jump from deep concentration to guiding another developer to answering an unrelated work email over to a chat with a remote developer then off to a meeting.

It is a challenge to remain focused.
But for me it is a requirement to get things done.

As I've transitioned into a mentor and lead role, I am also responsible for growing my teams capabilities.
This runs contrary to keeping focused.

Over the past year I've worked towards adopting explicit modes of operation.
I need to enter into different head spaces.

Look to the venerable and beloved `vi` and `vim`.

It has the concept of modes:

* Normal (Command)
* Insert
* Command-Line
* Replace
* Visual
* Select

These modes focus on the tasks you are trying to accomplish.
Each mode has a single responsibility.

## Modes that I can think of

* Thinking on a solution
* Writing an isolated test
* Writing an integration test
* Writing the first pass of a solution
* Working on a feature as isolated tests begin passing but the integrated tests continue to fail
* Refining how a test reads
* Refactoring the first pass to a bearable solution
* Writing an off-hand commit message
* Preparing a branch for a pull request
* Reviewing a pull request
* Reviewing a branch not yet ready for pull request review
* Meetings - my goal is to get out of meetings as quick as possible with clear action items
* Reflection
* Word Smithing
