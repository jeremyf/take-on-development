# Preface

Since early in my professional programming career, I have often worked alone.
It began while working as an actuarial analyst.

Early on I realized most of what was needed was automation.
The company was small and unable to staff all of its analyst positions.
I ended up automating away the need for one of the positions that was needed but never staffed.

Working alone continued at my next job as each developer worked on a single project, often separate from other developers. For my next job, there were a total two developers stretched between system administration, middleware development, up to javascript and CSS development.

And now I find myself working on a team that is comprised of people at my institution as well as members at several different institutions.

This collaboration is revelatory.
First, I have habits that are hard to break; I struggle to be a member of the team player.
But I have an arsenal for shooting most kinds of trouble.

Inside this book you will find how I go about doing things.
Are these the best ways to be doing things?
Maybe, maybe not.
But it is my take on developing in the open.
