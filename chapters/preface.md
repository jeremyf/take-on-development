# Preface

Since early in my professional programming career, I have often worked alone.
It began while working as an actuarial analyst, but realizing most of what was needed was programatic automation.
It continued at my next job as each developer worked primarily on a single project, separate from other developers.
And at the previous job, there were a total two developers stretched between system administration, middleware development, up to javascript and CSS development.
And now I find myself working on a team that is comprised of people at my university and people at several different universities.

This collaboration has been very revelatory.
I have habits that are hard to break; I struggle to be a team player.
But I also have a tremendous number of heuristics for troubleshooting and getting started from the most basic instructions.
