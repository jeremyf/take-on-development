# Preamble

This work has been a labor of love.
I write it in my spare time.

I warn you, this work is not complete, but I hope there is useful information even in its gestational state.
This is something I feel needs to get out and into the open.

# Preface

Since early in my professional programming career, I have often worked alone.

Working alone began while working as an actuarial analyst.
The company was small and unable to staff all of its analyst positions.
I realized most of what was needed was automation.
I ended up automating away the need for one of the positions that the company never staffed.

Working alone continued at my next job as each developer worked on a single project.
I did end up mentoring a new developer, and we worked well together.

For my next job, there were a total of two developers stretched between system administration, server-side application development, up to client-side application development via javascript, HTML and CSS development.
No worries, it was a major application for our employer.

And now I find myself working on a team that is comprised of people at my institution as well as members at several different institutions.
My team is distributed: by location, by a multitude of projects, and varying hours of commitment per week.

I've learned a lot from the latest collaborations.
First, I have habits that are hard to break; I struggle to be a member of the team.
Second, I value face to face interaction, but want to retreat to my desk so I can get work done.

I have been tasked with being the technical lead.
It has been an occassion for personal growth.

I'm discovering that I have an arsenal for shooting most kinds of trouble.
Inside this book you will find some heuristic tools, advice, and even conjecture.

Are these the best ways to be doing things?
Maybe, maybe not.
But it is my take on developing in the open.
