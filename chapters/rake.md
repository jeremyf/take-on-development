# Rake

One of the late [Jim Weirich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Weirich)'s pervasive contributions to the Ruby community.
For many it is synonimous with "the script that run's my Rails project's tests."

```console
$ rake -w

rake install    ./bundler-1.5.2/lib/bundler/gem_helper.rb:43:in `install'
rake load_app   ./railties-4.0.3/lib/rails/tasks/engine.rake:1:in `<top (required)>'
rake release    ./bundler-1.5.2/lib/bundler/gem_helper.rb:48:in `install'
```
