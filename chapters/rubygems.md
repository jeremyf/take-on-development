If you spend anytime working in Ruby, you will make use of Gems.
Rails is distributed as a gem.

## Making Your Own Gems

If you are working on something that could be shared, consider making it a gem.
In fact, many institutions make gems to share amongst their teams or projects.

I recommend using Bundler's `bundle gem <NAME>` command to create your own gems.
I go into (more detail about the `bundle gem`)[/bundler#sec-bundle-gem] command in the [Bundler](/bundler) chapter.
